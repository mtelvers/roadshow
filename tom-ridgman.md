Tom is a mechanical engineer who learnt to ring in Lancashire in 1987. After moving to the West Midlands in the early ‘90s he was introduced to a group organised by John Cater who were carrying out maintenance and refurbishment projects in the Derbyshire area. A further move to Cambridgeshire in the mid ‘90s brought him in contact with the Huntingdonshire Church Bell Restoration Society (HCBRS) run by Chris Higgins which carried out similar, but more ambitious projects, where the relevant PCC had no funds to spare for the bells.

He has been the bell advisor to the Ely Diocesan Association of Church Bellringers (EDACBR) since 2009 and has merged the activities of the HCBRS into the Association Bells Sub-committee which is mainly focussed on inspections, maintenance and training of steeple keepers with the help of 4 District Bell Advisors. The current large project is the installation of a frame and 6 new bells in St Clements Church Cambridge for a new Association ringing centre.
