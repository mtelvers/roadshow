Marcus has worked in insurance for 37 years and been with Ecclesiastical Insurance since 2005. He is a Fellow of the Chartered Insurance Institute and a Chartered Insurer. Since 2012 he has been in the role of Church Underwriting Manager, dealing with churches and cathedrals on a daily basis. Whilst being a ringer is not a pre-requisite for his job he believes it helps! As well as regular meetings with the CCCBR he writes articles for the Ecclesiastical website and publications and advising on ringing queries and claims within the Company

Becca has worked for Ecclesiastical for a little over three years, in the Risk Management Department. Her day-to-day job involves undertaking remote surveys of churches and offering risk management advice to ensure the well-running of the building and reduce the likelihood of incidents occurring. Becca learnt to ring when she was four years old and has moved around the country â€“ starting in the north west, growing up in the south east, with the benefit of the London ringing scene on her doorstep, and latterly moving to the south west, where she now lives. As a relative novice to the insurance industry, Becca learns a lot from working closely with Marcus when ringing-related queries or claims come in to Ecclesiastical.
