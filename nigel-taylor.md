Nigel learnt to ring in Oxfordshire in 1970. He cycled to Hughenden to learn surprise Major, ringing with an excellent band and also cycled to other local churches and obtained permission to view the bells, taking notes. Nigel was all set to become a tax inspector but instead joined the Whitechapel Bell foundry becoming Tower bell Production manager. He learnt every process from designing a profile, moulding, applying inscriptions to casting and tuning. When the foundry closed in June 2017, he became an independent bell consultant. Nigel has designed and tuned bells for two of the bell hanging companies, and project managed several projects, including a carillon, and a 13.5 ton clock bell.Now almost retired, he has time to spend with his wife, Julia, and operate his model railway. Nigel still rings regularly and has taken up peal ringing again. He presently lives and rings in Essex and particularly enjoys organising outings.
