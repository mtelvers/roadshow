  excerpt: As restrictions to ringing continue for some time yet, the association
    of Ringing Teachers (ART) and the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers (CCCBR)
    have joined forces to bring a series of activities, teaching, and support ways
    in which we can help ringers and bands stay together and then recover.
