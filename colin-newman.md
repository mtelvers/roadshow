Colin learned to ring at Chigwell Row in Essex at the age of 10, becoming tower captain at the age 16 and District Master at the age of 19. In addition to his commitments developing a band at Chigwell Row, Colin spent many hours in his formative years, attending practice at Barkingside under the guidance of Dennis Ellisdon, and later at Dagenham, practicing for and attempting (mostly successfully) peals of 23 Spliced Surprise Major under the watchful eye of Dr John Armstrong.

Colin has been actively involved with the Ancient Society College Youths since the mid 1990s, serving through the stewardships on 2002 and 2003, and then as Master in 2004. He is currently an ASCY representative on the Central Council, and there leads the Councilâ€™s Workgroup for Schools and Youth Groups.

Colin gets involved in all levels of ringing from teaching of handing skills to ringing peals of Surprise Maximus. He gets the most pleasure from observing others, especially youngsters, develop and achieve high standards.
