Come to the Roadshow looking the part! We have a great polo shirt to mark the Nottingham weekend in a nice ‘Sherwood Forest’ green. The President has rather rashly committed to buy a pint at the bar for anyone who attends the Roadshow wearing one!

The window for our bulk order of polo shirts closed on 16th August.  Should you wish to order a polo shirt you may contact the maufacturer, Adur Trading, directly however there is no assurance that it will be ready in time for the event.

Adur Trading can be contacted via [www.wearyourlogo.co.uk](https://www.wearyourlogo.co.uk), or by email at [sales@wearyourlogo.co.uk](mailto:sales@wearyourlogo.co.uk) or by telephone on 01903 766 228 or 01903 755 355.  Collection from Lancing West Sussex or postage charges would be applicable.
