Arthur teaches History and Politics in a school in Birmingham, having taught in a range of schools over the last 10 years. He also has leadership responsibilities for teaching, learning and assessment. When Arthur began his teacher training, very little time was spent considering how people learn ''yet I am convinced that for us to be effective teachers, comprehending how our minds retain information is critical''. Outside of teaching, he is Secretary to the St Martin's Guild of bell ringers, a keen runner and passionate about travelling, reading and theatre.
